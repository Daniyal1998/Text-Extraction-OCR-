# Text-Extraction-OCR

This was my Summer Internship Project and I had worked on some very promising Technology like Python, Tesseract. 
The main goal of this project was to Build a Generic Solution for the automation of Invoices so that the manual touchpoints in this process can be removed.

To achive this we divided the task into mainly 4 steps:-
1. Pre-Processing 
2. Classification
3. Text Extraction
4. Data Cleaning and Structuralization.

The pre-processing is done using OpenCV to remove/reduce noise. This step is followed by Classification based on type of Image.
Classification uses Tensorflow and Keras. Classification is required mainly in data cleaning and Structuralization part.
Text Extraction from the image is the Third step in this Project. 
Tesseract is used for the extraction of text form image. NLP is then used for cleaning and for its structuralization.
To make this as a service it can be done using Flask etc.

This is just a brief overview about the Project.
